# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.
3. (extra: Learn about what exactly Git is from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).)

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

To stage the interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., a jungle, the kitchen) When is it happening?

_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? Who else is there? If you reflect on the design of current day interactive devices like the Amazon Alexa, it’s clear they didn’t take into account people who had roommates, or the presence of children. Think through all the people who are in the setting.

_Activity:_ What is happening between the actors?

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., jumping to a tree, opening the fridge). 

The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

Sketch a storyboard of the interactions you are planning. It does not need to be perfect, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 

> Setting:
> > This interaction is happening at any indoor space. For example, such interaction can happen in the bedroom, kitchen, living room, or the office.

> Players:
> > The players are anyone who occupy in the setting and flying bugs. 

> Activity:
> > The device serves as an indoor tool to help catching flying bugs. The device light is green when it doesn't detect any moving objects (idle). It turns to yellow when it detects a flying object (active), and will try to catch the flying object with the clam tool. Once there is a bug inside, the device light will turn red to indicate so.

> Goal:
> > The goal of the device is to make catching bugs easier.  

\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*

Present your idea to the other people in your breakout room. You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*
> I generated this idea after the breakout session, so I wasn't able to get feedback yet.


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
> The device also requires the bug to be in the physical range of the clam tool to be caught. It also has to be very fast to catch all the bugs in the physical range. Right now, the device can also only catch one bug at a time. It has to wait for some sort of reset/cleaning from the human actor to resume to the idle mode.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
> I want to continue ideating on a system where the device can automatically pass the caught bug to the bottom box area (as a "trash can") so that it can continue to catch other bugs before a human actor is able to reset/clean it. Perhaps the bottom of the clam tool can also be a location to place a bait to attract bugs to enter the clam tool region.

## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*
> I wasn't able to get Tinkerbelle running on my Mac. It hung for a while and did nothing. I wasn't able to resolve the issue.


## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype.

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*


## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop a costume so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*
![IMG_0317](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35357433/132262678-e2b7eea6-16a4-4532-9ea3-825587094fc3.jpg)

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*
> I wanted to design a device that is simple and intuitive enough to use and achieves the purpose well. I am still experimenting with the shapes of the clam tool to allow maximum efficiency in catching a bug. I have chosen the curved shape to allow more room inside to enclose a bug when trying to catch a bug.

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*
> I am linking the same video as above because it communicates what I have in mind for the current stage of prototype.
> > [Link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCYer9ZyOwE)

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 



# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*
> One common feedback was that there was no interaction between people and the device. If the device were to be fully automatic, there is no human involvement necessary. The prototype also does not clearly illustrate how the bug catcher is going to work yet. 

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*

## Part A. Plan 

To stage the interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., a jungle, the kitchen) When is it happening?

The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

Sketch a storyboard of the interactions you are planning. It does not need to be perfect, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 

> Setting:
> > This interaction can happen anywhere.

> Players:
> > The players are anyone with a morning routine.

> Activity:
> > The device serves as a morning routine time tracking tool. User can customize color, text, and time for each task. Once turned on (when user has woken up), the device will play the colors with their corresponding time in a sequence, until all the sequence is finished. Each color will gradually become more and more opaque in their own segment, signifying how much time has passed for that task. A buzz sound will also be played after each task is done to remind user to move on to the next task.

> Goal:
> > The goal of the device is to help user stay on track with their morning routine tasks.

\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
> The device requires to be visible at all times to be effective. It would be best for it to be a wearable device so it is easy to carry it arround.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
> It would be nice for it to display colors that can serve as a tool to uplift user's mood for the day as well.

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*
> I want this device to be very convenient to carry around, hence the wearable watch design.
